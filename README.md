# css-normalizer
Predictably normalize modern CSS across browsers. The only reason I'm not using a "normal" normalizer is because I don't really know what's in that normalizer (it's really too big for me to quickly know everything that's in it), and I want to know everything that's affecting these HTML/CSS experiments.
